# Sales Analysis explores a companies sales and answers questions that would provide critical information for the company
# Titanic Predictor attempts to predict which members of the Titanic survived based on a machine learning technique known as Random Tree Classifier
# House Price Predictor uses a machine learning technique from sklearn known as DecisionTreeRegressor to predict the prices of houses from a data set I found. Cross Validation was also performed to more accurately determine the strength of the model
# The predictors of in-hospital mortality for admitted patients remain poorly characterized. I aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among admitted patients.
# The Medical Cost Personal Datasets link takes you to a jupyter notebook in which I used XGBoost to predict the price of insurance using simple variables. Afterwards I did some hyperparameter tuning to set the amount of trees to 9 to get the most accurate model
